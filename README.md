**Carve** is a VS Code extension that gives you a live, no-install 2D and 3D preview of [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) `.scad` files — entirely in-browser via WebAssembly. No native OpenSCAD binary required.

## Features

- 🔄 **Live preview** — open any `.scad` file, hit `Ctrl+K V`, and watch your model update as you type
- 📐 **2D geometry** — previews top-level 2D models as SVG, automatically switching between 2D and 3D as you edit
- 🧩 **Hybrid preview** — shows independent flat 2D profiles beside solid 3D geometry in one orbitable scene
- 🔎 **2D navigation** — zoom to fit, wheel/pinch zoom, drag to pan, plus a coordinate grid and measured X/Y axes
- 🧱 **Self-contained** — ships the full OpenSCAD engine as ~10 MB of WebAssembly, plus a Three.js mesh viewer
- 🧭 **OrbitControls** — drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
- 📤 **Export** — STL / 3MF / OFF / AMF / OBJ via `Carve: Export STL`
- 🪲 **Inline diagnostics** — OpenSCAD parser/render errors surface in VS Code's Problems pane
- 🌐 **Works in vscode.dev / Codespaces / Remote SSH** — pure WASM, no native deps
- 🎨 **Syntax highlighting** for the SCAD language

## Usage

1. Open any `.scad` file
2. Press **`Ctrl+K V`** (`Cmd+K V` on macOS) to open the preview beside the editor
3. Edit your code — the model re-renders ~500 ms after you stop typing
4. Drag the viewer to orbit, scroll to zoom
5. Run **`Carve: Export STL`** from the command palette to save geometry to disk

## Commands

| Command | Default keybinding | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Carve: Open Live Preview` | `Ctrl+K V` | Open the preview pane beside the editor |
| `Carve: Re-render` | `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Force a re-render of the current file |
| `Carve: Export STL` | — | Export the current model to disk |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `carve.autoRender` | `true` | Re-render as you type |
| `carve.debounceMs` | `500` | Delay before re-rendering after a change |
| `carve.exportFormat` | `binstl` | Format for `Carve: Export STL` (`binstl`, `asciistl`, `off`, `amf`, `3mf`, `obj`) |
